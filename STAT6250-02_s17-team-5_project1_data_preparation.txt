This file prepares the dataset described below for analysis.
[Dataset Name] Dropouts by Race & Gender

[Experimental Units] California public K-12 schools

[Number of Observations] 59,316    

[Number of Features] 36

[Data Source] The file http://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/dlfile/dlfile.aspx?
cLevel=School&cYear=2015-16&cCat=Dropouts&cPage=filesdropouts for dropout 
data for 2015-2016 were downloaded, along with 
ftp://ftp.cde.ca.gov/demo/schlname/pubschls.txt
to cross-reference county, district, and individual school details. They were
each downloaded as text files and imported to Excel in individual sheets as 
tab-delimited text, the schools file was used to provide necessary detail for 
the dropout data file, through VLOOKUP commands. The resulting workbook
is named dropout_dataset_2015_2016.csv.

and http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/fspubschls.asp (school and district data)

[Unique ID] The columns  CDS_CODE, Ethnic(ity), and Gender form a
composite key

* build analytic dataset from dropout dataset with the least number of columns and
minimal cleaning/transformation needed to address research questions in
corresponding data-analysis files
